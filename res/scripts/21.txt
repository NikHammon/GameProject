/DRACE/
Welcome, good people of REDHAVEN. We gather here today,:
not to mourn the loss of yet another dearly beloved IMPERIAL EMISSARY, but to:
pass the sacred duty onto one of you. To your right and to your left and the toughest:
and most courageous warriors in all REDHAVEN.;
/DRACE/
I am confident that whoever is chosen will serve their kingdom with strength:
and honor. Mark my words, being the IMPERIAL EMISSARY is no easy task, as you are:
more than just a resource to REDHAVEN, like your predecessors you are a symbol of hope,:
a puinsher or evil, and in the end, a martyr to your kingdom. And God knows we need a;
/DRACE/
hero now more than ever. More and more monsters have been appearing and I have:
recieved word that the kingdom of HARMONIA has succumbed to a wicked plague that:
decimated it's citizens. No man was left alive and my dear brother, HARMONIA's:
Soveriegn's OBIN has mysteriously dissapeared. I recieved word of this from my;
/DRACE/
late brother's wife, the lovely Sovereigness, CASSIOPIA. As a sign of solidarity:
between REDHAVEN and the fallen HARMONIA, I invited her to appoint our newest:
IMPERIAL EMISSARY. CASSIOPIA, darling which of these fine men do you think has what:
it takes to be REDHAVEN's next IMPERIAL EMISSARY?;
