Wow.:
Who knew our SOVEREIGNs were so sentimental.;
/SEBASTIAN/
Yeah, sorry to cut the reunion short, but BUDAROTH is still:
out there and likely plotting our doom.;
/*/
He may have a difficult time doing any of that for the time:
being.;
/DRACE/
What do you mean?;
/OBIN/
He lost his puppet. DOLLFACE is no more.    :
Without her, and still in a powerless form, he's not capable:
of harming us.;
/DRACE/
This is most excellent news! If we don't have to worry about the:
constant threat of destruction, maybe things will return to normal!;
/OBIN/
It will not be that simple. BUDAROTH managed to demolish two kingdoms.:
It will take years for physical reconstruction and for our people to:
make peace with the loss of thier loved ones.           :
But then, I too suspect things will return to normal.;
