Nothing of the sort.    :
Far in the east lies a DUNGEON of immense difficulty.:
Many a times I have tried to conquer it, not once have I:
been successful.;
/*/
So why try so many times?;
/RUBEL/
You have seen fairy fountains, have you not? Well, in this:
DUNGEON, known as PALACE OF THE GODS is rumored to have the:
grandest of all fairy fountains. It is named ETERNITY SPRINGS:
because they say those who drink from it's waters, never age,;
/RUBEL/
and those who gaze upon are filled with a delight they hadn't:
experienced since childhood.         :
It is here that wishes come true.;
/*/
Ok, so other than the view and the wishing well, why go there?;
/RUBEL/
There is also said to be treasures and gold beyond your wildest:
dreams.;
/*/
Sorry. Where did you say this PALACE OF THE GODS was again?;
/RUBEL/
Here, let me mark it on your explorer map.;
