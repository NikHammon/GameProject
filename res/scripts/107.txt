You know, it really is pathetic that they're still sending you:
to do thier dirty work. All this talk of kingdoms with their pride and:
honor, but at the end of the day, look who the cowards are hiding behind.;
/DOLLFACE/
You.              :
A weak, pathetic, little girl.       :
It makes me sick. I'm the one that choose you!;
/DOLLFACE/
And you want to know why?            :
Because you don't matter! You're a nobody!;
/*/
Blah, blah, blah. Everyone's weak, everyone's pathetic.     :
Don't you have anything new to say.         :
But wait this time's different.      :
That's not fear in your voice, is it, DOLLFACE?;
/*/
Serves you right.          :
It's about time you learned that everyone matters or nobody does.;
/DOLLFACE/
Me??!! Afraid of you??!!                   :
Impossible!;
/*/
I'm not interested in your ego. Just tell me one thing.     :
How does someone who comes from so much wealth and nobility, need:
any of this?;
/DOLLFACE/
I had all the gold all the respect in the world.:
But it all meant nothing.         ;
/DOLLFACE/
Power is everything.:
And I'm not talking about the power that royals have,:
I'm talking about pure power. I'm talking about the kind of power:
that lets you do whatever you want to whoever you want.;
/DOLLFACE/
That's all that matters.;
/*/
You're completly insane.;
/DOLLFACE/
MUAHAHA! Look at you, playing hero. I was really trying to savor this as:
long as possible, but you really want to fight.:
That's ok.                                                      :
I'm going to enjoy this even more.;
