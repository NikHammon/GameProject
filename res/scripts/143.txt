You haven't, by any chance, come across:
an GENOBLADE ARTIFACT like this before have you?;
/RUBEL/
Hmmmmm.....                   :
No, no I'm afraid not.         :
I have however, come across the symbol such a relic bears.:
I stumbled across it while traveling through the FORSAKEN LAND.;
/*/
What's that?;
/RUBEL/
The FORSAKEN LAND is a DUNGEON that took me many years:
to discover. Most explorers think the DUNGEON itself is:
a myth, and few have ever tried to locate it because nothing:
is guarded their except dry, empty desert.;
/RUBEL/
But not me!         :
I sought out the FORSAKEN LAND not for riches or treasure,:
but for the thrill of adventure!         :
And to prove that RUBEL doesn't quit when everyone else does.;
/*/
Say, would you mind showing me to the FORSAKEN LAND?     :
Assuming you still remember where it is.;
/RUBEL/
It was many years ago that I was there, but my memory:
does not fail. I'll get you to the FORSAKEN LAND if it's:
the last thing I do.;
/*/
Perfect. Then let's go.     :
I've got an evil plan to meddle with.     : 
Right after I get my beauty sleep, of course.;
