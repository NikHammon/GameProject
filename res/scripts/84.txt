Tis true! We traded our homeland away for gold! Had we know what:
would have happened, we never would have made that foolish deal! Never:
in a million years!;
/FINEAS/
Spare us your apologizes you sniveling sea-creature. Who did:
you sell the explosives to?;
/CRAWFORD/
Unfortunately, we did not get the chance to look upon our client.:
They were highly particular about anonymity.;
/FINEAS/
So you're about as useless as you are foolharty.;
/SERII/
Oh please, just give me five minutes alone with them!:
I can make those two regret being born.;
