Wait!? Why do you know my name?;
/BUDAROTH/
Simple.              :
I know who you are, because I made you who you are.           :
So, the question is...            :
Do you know what that is?;
/*/
I'm not sure what you're talking about.;
/BUDAROTH/
Let's start from the beginning. Not the beginning of your:
boring, boring life as a farm hand, but from the moment you:
were selected as REDHAVEN's IMPERIAL EMISSARY. Do you remember:
what happened that day, *?;
/*/
Yeah, of course. Everybody was in CASTLE SQUARE, when SOVEREIGNESS:
CASSIOPIA suggested to DRACE that I should be the next IMPERIAL:
EMISSARY.;
/BUDAROTH/
Yessss, yesss, precisely. But REDHAVEN's people didn't like that very:
much did they? You aren't their typical IMPERIAL EMISSARY are you?;
/*/
What are you gettting at?;
/BUDAROTH/
Aren't you curious as to why you were choosen?;
/*/
I just got a very bad feeling about this.;
/BUDAROTH/
*, There's someone here that would very much like to see you...      :
Come on now, don't be shy SOVEREIGNESS.;
