/FINEAS/
I'm here.:
What's going on?;
/*/
The theives! They didn't have the WATER BOMBs with them!:
They left them with a client who's still in RHINECREST!;
/FINEAS/
I'm afraid not...;
/*/
Not what?! We need to warn the city! They must evacuate:
immediately!;
/FINEAS/
I'm afraid there's no need. The city was destroyed last night.        :
You're too late, *.;
/*/
The entire city!:
No! No, this can't be... How was the entire city destroyed by:
a few explosives!;
/FINEAS/
RHINECREST was built on a plateu over the water. When the right underwater:
supports were damaged the city gave way and was flooded. Everything was:
destroyed.;
/*/
But why!? Who would do such a thing?!;
/SERII/
We don't know, but whoever they are is going to to regret it!:
Step aside, *. I'm going start by turing their cowardly errand boys:
into fish food!;
