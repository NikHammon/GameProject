/CASSIOPIA/
In the meantime, I suggest we find a new approach to:
figuring out who destroyed HARMONIA.;
/SEBASTIAN/
Why bother?:
I think we all know who's behind this.;
/CASSIOPIA/
You can't be suggesting that he's returned.;
/DRACE/
Who else has half as much of a reason to punish the royal family?;
/CASSIOPIA/
LORD BUDAROTH...;
/*/
Who?;
/SEBASTIAN/
You haven't heard of LORD BUDAROTH?:
Were you raised in a barn?;
/*/
Yes.                     :
So I don't know who that guy is. Big deal.:
He sounds old and gross anyways.;
/DRACE/
It is a big deal actually.:
Several centuries worth to be exact.:
But since we don't have all day I'll give you the condensed version.;
/*/
Thank god.:
History is so, yawn.;
/DRACE/
Long before the kingdom of REDHAVEN, the tradition of the IMPERIAL:
EMISSARY, or you, *, ever exsisted, there was a great and mighty:
kingdom.;
/DRACE/
But this once poweful, kingdom had a ferocious enemy.:
It was a race that lacked the digintiy to be considered man,:
and killed with too much malice to be considered beast.:
My ancestors called thes ravenous creatures, the SCOURGE.;
/DRACE/
LORD BUAROTH was the last SCOURGE general, as his army was destroyed:
by a single warrior.;
/*/
One man defeated an entire army?;
/DRACE/
Do remember that at this time, no one ever ventured pass the:
kingdom walls. This man was rumored to be the first ever to see the:
outside world. When his kingdom was threated by the SCOURGE, he set off:
to foreign lands and returned with arcaine materials and through their;
/DRACE/
magical properities, constructed the GENOBLADE,:
a weapon so deadly it annihilated the SCORGE legion.:
LORD BUDAROTH, having lost all power, was cursed to bear:
the souls of all whom he had killed.;
/*/
So every living thing he killed, became another voice:
in his head?:
That's enough to drive anyone insane.;
/DRACE/
And it did. BUDAROTH was never seen again.:
The GENOBLADE was hidden so no one could ever weild such power again.:
And the great kingdom split into the kingdoms of RHINECREST, REDHAVEN:
and HARMONIA.;
/*/
And what became of the hero?;
/DRACE/
The hero was titled the first-ever IMPERIAL EMISSARY.:
The people realized the importance of sending out a brave soul to:
explore the uncivilized lands, and the name was catchy.;
/*/
You know, I think I liked it better when I got to run around:
aimlessly.;
/CASSIOPIA/
If it is BUDAROTH that is behind tha destruction of HARMONIA,:
then RHINECREST and it's SOVERIEGN FINEAS must be warned.;
/SEBASTIAN/
I'd like to agree, but I don't think anyone should be informed:
until we are absolutely sure what we're dealing with.:
Do you have any idea how much panic would be set on if people belived:
LORD BUDAROTH had returned?;
/DRACE/
He's right.:
As it stands, there is nothing we can do until more is found out.;
