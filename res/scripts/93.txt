CASSIOPIA?!            :
What are you doing here!             :
What happened to your face!;
/BUDAROTH/
Here is a perfect example of how power corrupts. Her body's:
reaction to helping me reduce two kingdoms to rubble is reflected:
in her flesh.;
/CASSIOPIA/
It's true. BUDAROTH's dark magic has made me more powerful than:
any human could ever dream of, but it's not without it's side effects.;
/*/
So you're possessed then? You're under a spell and are acting as his:
puppet.;
/CASSIOPIA/
MUAHAHA! As if!          :
You're more of a puppet than I am! IMPERIAL EMISSARYs are all the:
same. They act like they're brave, strong heroes, when the reality is,:
they're nothing more than their SOVEREIGN's lap-dogs.;
/*/
What about DRACE, and FINEAS, and all of REDHAVEN? Have you just:
been lying to us thee entire time?;
/CASSIOPIA/
MUAHAHA! I never actually lied to any of you idiots.         :
Except the time I told you, "You might turn out to be the greatest IMPERIAL:
EMISSARY REDHAVEN's ever seen!";
/*/
I don't believe this. You're not feeling like yourself CASSIOPIA.;
/CASSIOPIA/
What isn't there to believe? BUDAROTH's not pulling any strings here,:
we're partners. You see, it was I who sought him out. After all these years,:
he was weakened by curse. It was I who inspired him to want his old power back.:
It was I who made him realize that his kingdom could be restored to its former glory.;
/CASSIOPIA/
Naturally, I wanted something in return. So we began experimenting with dark magic.:
I'm telling you, there's nothing like it. Within weeks I had the ability to turn my husband,:
SOVEREIGN OBIN, into an owl. It wasn't long after the SOVEREIGN was out of the way that:
HARMONIA was destroyed. My master an I were protected by ancient SCOURGE spells, but the;
/CASSIOPIA/
others weren't. It was terrible really...          :
For them, of course. The moment when panic sets in and all hope is extinguished:
it really was like seeing a whole new side of my people. You know that feeling when:
you think you know someone...;
/*/
I'm beginning to get the idea.;
/CASSIOPIA/
Anyways, this is when it gets fun. My partner and I set our:
sights on REDHAVEN next. When I arrived, it just so happened that:
they were picking a new IMPERIAL EMISSARY. Naturally, I thought it should:
be you. As you are the weakest, most pathetic looking freak in that kingdom.;
/CASSIOPIA/
Convincing your SOVERIEGN to let me pick the next EMISSARY was:
all too easy, given his well known weaknesses. I figured I let you have fun:
for a couple of weeks, running errands for me, screwing up quests, and letting people:
get killed. Then I'd kill you myself after when we were finished.;

So here we are..;
