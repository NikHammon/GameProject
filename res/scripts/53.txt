/DRACE/
Yes, business. That's what she was here for.:
But what about you, care to introduce yourself?;
/SEBASTIAN/
My name is SEBASTIAN.:
And I'm HARMONIA's IMPERIAL EMISSARY.;
/DRACE/
You're from HARMONIA!? What about the disastrous plague?;
/SEBASTIAN/
Well, I wasn't there either when the plague hit. I was out on a:
quest and when I returned what I found made me sick to my stomach. Bodies:
on top of bodies lined the cobblestones, each twisted in positions of unthinkable:
agony. I remeber that tortured expression of sheer terror and agony on the face of;
/SEBASTIAN/
every man woman and child. I turned to run, but came face to face with the devil:
who wrought this plague on Harmonia, the plague that senselessly butchered my people.;
/DRACE/
Well? What was this monster?!;
/SEBASTIAN/
I couldn't tell you. It's right after seeing the beast that my memory becomes:
spotty. If I try and focus on what I saw it's like nails being driven into the back:
of my brain.;
/DRACE/
Unfortunate.;
