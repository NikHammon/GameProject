/CASSIOPIA/
Hello, *.;
/CASSIOPIA/
You'll be pleased to hear that I did, in fact, find something:
of use in my research last night.;
/CASSIOPIA/
Across the ocean to the west there is a temple on an island. According:
to ancient lore, here in this temple lies and artifact with the power to reverse:
the effects of dark magic.;
/CASSIOPIA/
Recover the relic and bring it to me. There's a chance this is the key:
to unlocking SEBASTIAN's memory. If he can remember who is responsible for:
destroying HARMONIA we have a shot at stopping this monster before it:
strikes again.;
/*/
Are you worried that the monster will come here?       :
To REDHAVEN?;
