Hi you!;
/*/
Waahh!    :
You guys can talk;
/FAIRY/
Of course we can silly. Welcome to ETERNITY SPRINGS.;
/*/
So how does this work?:
Is there a limit on how many wishes I get?;
/FAIRY/
You don't actually get to make wishes here. Most humans:
find the experience satisfying enough that they can't ask:
for much more.;
/*/
Oh.         :
Well then.;
/FAIRY/
You seem disappointed. It makes me sad when people come here:
and are disappointed. Here is what I will do. I will increase the:
size of your wallet so you can carry more money with you. That way:
you will be happy where ever you go.;
