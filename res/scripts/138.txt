How should we know? This has got nothing:
to do with us.;

You're right. Whatever's going on, I need to:
get back to REDHAVEN.                       :
Oh! Before I go, would it be too much to ask if:
the items...;
/SHADOW CHILDREN/
We've already returned them to the old woman's:
shop. We only stole them in the first place so:
we could meet you.;

Thanks guys. So long!;
/SHADOW CHILDREN/ 
Bye, bye!     :
Come back and play with us sometime!;
