Hello IMPERIAL EMISSARY. Do you wish to share traveller:
stories?;
/*/
Actually, I wanted to know if you have ever heard of:
a creature appearing and then vanishing from darkness?;
/RUBEL/
Darkness, you say?:
Do go on.;
/*/
I was asleep this morning and I heard a child's voice.:
It asked me if I wanted to come play and when I lifted my:
head it disappered into a cloud of shadows.;
/RUBEL/
Hmmm... It sounds like you had an encouter with one of the:
SHADOW CHILDREN. They rarely ever leave DARKNIGHT RIDGE, but:
clearly this one has taken a liking to you. Should you decide to:
go to DARKNIGHT RIDGE, be warned it is very difficult to tell what;
/RUBEL/
the fiends are up to. Thier childish antics are meerly a way:
of luring foolish travellers into a false sense of security.:
Stay on your guard and don't fall for their games. That's the:
only advice I can give you.;
/*/
Well, thanks.  :
I'm off to DARKNIGHT RIDGE to get ZARIA's items back and find:
out what the SHADOW CHILDREN have planned for me.;
