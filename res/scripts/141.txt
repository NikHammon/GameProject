/OBIN/
What is the matter?;
/*/
Is this symbol framiliar to you?;
* drew the symbol engraved on the top of the MYSTERIOUS:
ARTIFACT in the dirt for OBIN to see.;
/OBIN/
Why, yes of course!     :
That's the symbolic representation of the GENOBLADE.:
Don't tell me you plan to go searching for the legendary:
weapon.;
/OBIN/
You're a good IMPERIAL EMISSARY in your own right,:
* but no one has ever been able to find the GENOBLADE.;
/*/
I may not have a choice. Look, the GENOBLADE, the weapon:
that destroyed the SCOURGE, how does it work?     :
I mean, what exactly does it do?;
/OBIN/
The GENOBLADE was designed to exterminate all sentient life:
outside a desired radius. When the weapon was first activated:
it was inside the walls of the great kingdom. Everyone within:
the kingdom walls was safe, but everything outside was turned to ash.;
/OBIN/
This is why the GENOBLADE was hidden after the kingdom was:
divided. So no single kingdom would ever have that kind of power.;
/*/
But if someone found the weapon, they could kill everyone:
and everything just by turning it on?;
/OBIN/
Yes, that's how it works, but once again, finding it is out:
of the question. It's stayed hidden for centuries.;
/*/
I suspect LORD BUDAROTH may be after it.;
