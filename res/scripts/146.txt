/GENOBLADE GUARDIAN/
Do not take another step.  :
I am the GUARDIAN of this weapon any opponent that:
comes near it must be defeated.;
/*/
Yeah, well, you could have done a better job of that.:
The GENOBLADE has already been activated.:
We need to turn it off.;
/GENOBLADE GUARDIAN/
It is not my place to delegate how the weapon is used.:
I meerly serve to keep the unworthy from using it.;
/*/
You're not listening to me.:
If that weapon goes off alot of people are going to die.          :
And I can't let that happen.;
/GENOBLADE GUARDIAN/
Then prepare to be annihilated.;
