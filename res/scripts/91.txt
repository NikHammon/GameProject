Eww...         :
What are you?;
/????/
Ugggh. After all these years I assumed I no longer needed:
an introduction. Very well then, I am LORD BUDAROTH.       :
Although I must admit I'm really only a shadow of my former self.;
/*/
BUDAROTH, huh. I've definately heard of you, I just expected:
you to be a little more scary-looking or whatever.;
/BUDAROTH/
Oh, how words can hurt, young girl. Like a dagger to my cold, black:
heart.;
/BUDAROTH/
Have you any idea why you've come, my dear, *?;
/*/
To stop you...;
