/DRACE/
How does a human rationalize that?!;
/*/
She seemed to be a different person. Her skin was deformed, it looked:
like half her face had turned into a that of a porcelian doll.:
And the way she spoke had changed...          :
DRACE, she must have been under very dark influence.;
/DRACE/
But this monstrosity, this human with the face of a doll, was working:
with BUDAROTH?;
/*/
Yeah.;
/FINEAS/
Then she must be destroyed along with him.;
/DRACE/
So be it.;
/*/
Ok, then how are we going to destroy them? How can we even find:
them?;
/SEBASTIAN/
So far, it's seems like they've been finding us.;
/DRACE/
SEBASTIAN's right. BUDAROTH will come to us. He stil has REDHAVEN to:
destroy. Either that or he will try and lift his curse.;
/SEBASTIAN/
Is it possible?        :
Could he return to his true form?;
/FINEAS/
Only at the expense of royal blood. Which is why I'm suprised he's:
been more interested in razing kingdoms than killing SOVEREIGNs;
/*/
That's probably because he doesn't know how it works.;
/DRACE/
What do you mean?;
/*/
The last time we met, CASSIOPIA was gloating about how she turned her husband:
into an owl. Well, BUDAROTH wouldn't have been ok with that if he knew that he:
needed to kill you three to lift his curse.;
/DRACE/
But CASSIOPIA knew about the blood seal. That would mean...;
/FINEAS/
That would mean that BUDAROTH and the SOVEREIGNESS don't fully trust one:
another.;
/SERII/
So we don't have to worry about the blood seal?;
/FINEAS/
I would like to say yes, but I can't take that chance. If OBIN's alive out:
there, we need to find him first.;
/DRACE/
I agree. I'll have everyone in REDHAVEN on the look-out for...   :
an owl? Did you say?;
/*/
Yeah, she turned him into an owl.;
/DRACE/
Very well then. You get some sleep, *. There's not much we can do until:
that owl is sighted.;
