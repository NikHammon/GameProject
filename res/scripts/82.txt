SERII!!!;

I know you're upset. That's why I'm going to let your childish aggression slide.:
But do not think for one second that these tragedies haven't taken their toll on all of:
us.;

DRACE, where's CASSIOPIA?;
/DRACE/
The SOVEREIGNESS has fallen deathly ill. I suspect the plague that took HARMONIA:
now threatens to take her. She requested to stay in her castle an that no one be:
allowed near her. Although, were she here now, I know she would say that this is not the:
time for rivalry between the kingdoms, but a time for all of us to unite and stand;
/DRACE/
together against a greater evil that threatens to destroy us all.;
/FINEAS/
Well said.;
/SEBASTIAN/
So, assuming the fall of RHINECREST and HARMONIA are linked, we know that:
someone or something is going around destroying kingdoms.:
But what else? Where do we even start?;
