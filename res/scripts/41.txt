So it's my job to take quests, go to DUNGEONS, fight monsters, and:
and bring back treasure, all at the risk of my life?;
/CASSIOPIA/
You're correct.;
/*/
Then what made you think it was a good idea to pick me, out of all:
people for this?;
/CASSIOPIA/
I can't explain that to you right now. But I promise an answer:
to your question will come in due time.;
/*/
Fine. Just know that if, I mean, when I get killed I can't help:
but blame you.;
/CASSIOPIA/
I'm well aware of that but I ask you to trust me, and more importantly:
I ask that you trust yourself. As of right now I'm the only person:
in REDHAVEN that believes you're up to this.;
/*/
And is that supposed to make us friends?;
/CASSIOPIA/
Isn't it?;
