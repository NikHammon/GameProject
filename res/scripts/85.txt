Eeeeep! We do know one thing that might be useful!;
/FINEAS/
Spit it out roach.;

When our client picked up the explosives, we were blinded so we were:
unable to see them. However, we were able to smell them. It wasn't their natural:
aroma. It was the pungent, sulfuric smell of soot. It was strong, that only thing:
I'd ever smelt like that before was in-;
/FINEAS/
DRAGONBREATH CAVERN.;
/CRAWFORD/
That's the place! It was unmistakable.:
Our client had definately been spending significant time in:
DRAGONBREATH CAVERN before they met with us.;
/DRACE/
And if something was willing to spend that much time in DRAGONBREATH:
CAVERN before, there's a good chance it's gone back there now.;
/SERII/
Then send me in.            :
I'm the best IMPERIAL EMISSARY you've got, and I'm willing to die to:
avenge my kingdom.;
