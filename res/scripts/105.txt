It is I.;
/*/
(whew.) Thank goodness.;

For a second there you had me worried I was talking to myself again.:
Something I do way too much. Which reminds me I should really stop.      :
Nowwww...                               :
Ok, that was the last one...                ;
/OBIN/
Why have you come here?;
/*/
Oh right! I should have introduced myself first.     :
I am *, REDHAVEN's IMPERIAL EMISSARY. Your two brothers sent me.:
I need you to come with me back to REDHAVEN.;
/OBIN/
No, I'm afraid I won't be leaving with you. I have nothing to:
return to. My kingdom is destroyed and I wasn't even around to die:
by my people. I can't face my brothers.          ;
/OBIN/
I'm a failure as a SOVEREIGN and a failure as a human being.;
/*/
Uhhh, you're not exactly a human being anymore. Wouldn't it have been:
better to say that your a failure as an owl-person?;
/OBIN/
Fine. Then I'm a failure at symantics as well!;
/*/
Don't get your feathers ruffed. Seriously though, you need to come with:
me. Your brothers are afraid of the blood seal being broken.;
/OBIN/
You can go back and tell them there's nothing to worry about. I'm not so:
easy to track.;
/????/
But she is! MUAHAHA!;
